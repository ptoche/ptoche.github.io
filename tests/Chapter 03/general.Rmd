*** .explanation
See Table 3.1. See also discussion page 126. While the United Kingdom and France both accumulated debt to finance their wars (often agains each other), differences in their history explain why debt has often been greater in the United Kingdom. France defaulted during the French revolution and, less dramatically, at other times too. In the 20th century, France experienced greater rates of inflation, especially between the wars. After the nazi occupation of France in 1940, France did not resort to debt to finance the war effort (but contributed assets, labor, etc. to Germany), while the United Kingdom was never occupied (Hitler lost the 'Battle of Britain') and borrowed heavily.
