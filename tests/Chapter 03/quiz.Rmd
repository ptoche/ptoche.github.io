### Question 1

You deposit \\$100 into an interest-bearing account. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is 100. One year later, your balance is \\$110 and the CPI is 115.

1. The nominal interest rate is 15%, the inflation rate 10%, the real interest rate is 5%.
2. The nominal interest rate is 15%, the inflation rate 10%, the real interest rate is 10%.
3. The nominal interest rate is 15%, the inflation rate is 10%, the real interest rate is 15%.
4. _The nominal interest rate is 10%, the inflation rate 15%, the real interest rate is 5%._
5. The nominal interest rate is 10%, the inflation rate 15%, the real interest rate is 10%.
6. The nominal interest rate is 10%, the inflation rate 15%, the real interest rate is 15%.

*** .hint
The inflation rate is defined as the rate of growth of the CPI.

*** .explanation
The CPI rises from 100 to 110, so the inflation rate is 10%. The balance rises from \\$100 to \\$115, so the nominal interest rate is 15%. The real interest rate is (approximately) equal to the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate, $0.15 - 0.10 = 0.05$.
