  <p>&#39;Low inflation&#39; refers to annual inflation rates ranging from -1% to +2%. High inflation refers to annual inflation rates in excess of 4%. &#39;A period&#39; refers to most years within the given dates (at least half of the time) and for most countries (at least 3 of 5 countries).</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-explanation">
  <p>The period 1700-1914 was a period in which most currencies were pegged to gold or other precious metals at a fixed rate, resulting in moderate price fluctuations (caused mostly by gold discoveries and shortages). The period 1914-1929 was a period of post-war reconstruction, with government finances damaged by the first world war (especially Germany who was being forced to pay for the cost of the war), and goods and stock prices soaring. France and Germany experienced hyperinflation in the early 1920s. The period 2007-2014 was the period of the &#39;Great Recession&#39;, with countries (especially Europe and Japan) threatened by deflation.</p>

<div class="quiz-explanation">
  <p>A hyperinflation is defined as a period of large, sustained price rises, something like prices rising at an annualized rate of more than 50% for at least 6 months. </p>

<p>The most famous hyperinflation took place in Germany in 1923. In 1923, the rate of inflation reached 3.25 \(\times\) 10\(^{6}\) percent per month (prices double every 2 days). On 20 November 1923, the Rentenmark replaced the old mark at a rate of 1 to 10\(^{12}\).</p>

<p>In 1945-1946, Hungary experienced the worst hyperinflation on record. The peak inflation recorded was 1.3 \(\times\) 10\(^{16}\) percent per month (prices double every 15 hours). On 18 August 1946, the forint replaced the pengo at a rate of 1 to 4 \(\times\) 10\(^{29}\). </p>

<p>The most recent hyperinflation took place in Zimbabwe in 2008-2009, almost as extreme as Hungary, for an overall impact of 10\(^{25}\). Zimbabwe has abandoned its currency and now uses foreign currencies instead.</p>

  <p>A &#39;lender&#39; deposits \$100 for one year into an interest-bearing account paying an annual interest rate of 10%. A &#39;borrower&#39; takes a one-year loan for \$100 at the same bank at an annual interest cost of 11%. All interest payments are made at the end of the year, with no intermediate monthly payments.

  <p>Do not include the redistribution operated by the expected capital appreciation of the lender&#39;s deposit and expected cost of the loan for the borrower, as these are part of standard loan terms and are in accordance with the agreement entered by both parties.</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-explanation">
  <p>At the end of the year, the lender receives a nominal payment of \$110, while the borrower makes a nominal payment of \$111 (the difference is the bank&#39;s profit). The market&#39;s inflation forecast error is +2% (= 0.02), the excess of recorded inflation over expected inflation &mdash; thus, unexpected inflation reduces the real value of the lender&#39;s end-of-year balance by 2%, and reduces the real value of the borrower&#39;s end-of-year repayment by 2%. The  lender suffers an unexpected real loss of 0.02 \(\times\) \$110 = \$2.2 (less than capital appreciation, so the lender&#39;s capital does not shrink in real terms). The borrower experiences an unexpected real gain of 0.02 \(\times\) \$111 = \$2.22 (less than the cost of the loan, so the borrower does not get money for free).</p>
