### Question 1

Since 1980, labor income inequality has risen sharply in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia (among others). This rise is due mainly to increased pay at the very top end of the distribution &mdash; the top 1% and especially the top 0.1%. Is the sharp discontinuity of pay at the very top consistent with 'marginal productivity theory'?  

1.  
Yes, because there is a corresponding discontinuity in observed skill levels, after accounting for a broad view of 'skill' (education, IQ, experience). 
2.  
Yes, because there is no corresponding discontinuity in observed skill levels, even after accounting for a broad view of 'skill' (education, IQ, experience). 
3.  
No, because there is a corresponding discontinuity in observed skill levels between the 9% and the 1% or between the 1% and the 0.1%.
4.  
_No, because there is no corresponding discontinuity in observed skill levels between the 9% and the 1% or between the 1% and the 0.1%._
