    <h3>Financial Reform for the 21st Century</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Policies to preserve the welfare state:

<ul>
<li><code>1</code>. financial <strong>transparency</strong> and international <strong>cooperation</strong></li>
<li><code>2</code>. a <strong>global and progressive</strong> tax on capital</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Progressive taxation</strong> &mdash; the greater the base, the greater the tax rate</li>
<li>The challenge of a global tax on capital: 

<ul>
<li><code>1</code>. a tax schedule applicable to global wealth</li>
<li><code>2</code>. rules to apportion revenues</li>
<li><code>3</code>. democratic support </li>
</ul></li>
<li>This <strong>Utopia</strong> could start with information sharing between the United States and the European Union. </li>

    <h3>A Global Tax on Net Wealth</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>The tax base would be <strong>&#39;net wealth&#39;</strong>, the market value of financial and non-financial assets &mdash; bank deposits, stocks, bonds, partnerships, equity in listed and unlisted firms, patents, real estate &mdash; <strong><em>net of debt</em></strong>. </li>
<li>A progressive tax schedule:

<ul>
<li>1%  on net assets between €1M and €5M</li>
<li>2%  on net assets above €5M</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A more progressive tax schedule:

<ul>
<li>1%  on net assets between €1M and €5M</li>
<li>2%  on net assets between €5M and €1B</li>
<li>5% on net assets above €1B</li>
<li>10% on net assets above €10B</li>

    <h3>A Global Tax on Net Wealth</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li><strong>Objectives</strong>:

<ul>
<li><code>1</code>. reduce inequality of wealth </li>
<li><code>2</code>. regulate the financial and banking system</li>
<li><code>3</code>. set rules for valuing assets, liabilities, and net wealth</li>
<li><code>4</code>. share financial and banking data</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Some European countries tax wealth &mdash; France, Switzerland, Spain, and until recently Germany and Sweden &mdash; but these taxes are riddled with exemptions and asset values are too far from market values.</li>
<li>Existing taxes on wealth are based on <strong>gross wealth</strong> &mdash; a heavily indebted person is taxed in the same way as a person with no debt.</li>

    <h3>Automatic Transmission of Banking Information</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>With existing tax loopholes, rich individuals and large corporations essentially &quot;set their own taxes&quot;. </li>
<li>The amount of wealth hidden in tax havens is staggering.</li>
<li>Tax havens defend bank secrecy because their clients evade taxes, not because privacy is valued per se.</li>
<li>Free trade and a welfare state are inconsistent with tax havens.</li>
<li>The first step towards the regulation of banking and financial markets is the automatic transmission of banking data across countries.</li>
<li>Free trade in goods, services, and capital requires international exchange of financial information.</li>

    <h3>Automatic Transmission of Banking Information</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Since 2015, the <strong>Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act</strong> (FATCA) requires all foreign banks to inform the United States Treasury Department about bank accounts and investments held abroad by US taxpayers.</li>
<li><strong>FATCA</strong> remains insufficient:

<ul>
<li>Sanctions are small &mdash; a 30% surtax on income that noncompliant banks derive from their US operations.</li>
<li>While large banks that need to do business in the US comply with FACTA, smaller banks specialize in &quot;non compliance&quot; &mdash; a profitable niche as long as business with US financial institutions is small.</li>

    <h3>Automatic Transmission of Banking Information</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>The 2003 <strong>European Union Savings Directive</strong> (EUSD) required the automatic exchange of information between member states on private savings income, and introduced a &#39;witholding tax&#39; to be deducted from interest earned by European Union residents on investments made in another member state. </li>
<li>The 2003/48/EC directive concerned only interest-bearing deposit accounts &mdash; with large fortunes held in equity consequently exempted.</li>
<li>In 2016, directive 2014/107/EU extended the scope of directive 2003/48/EC to include interest, dividends and other types of income.</li>
<li>Andorra, Austria, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, San Marino, and Switzerland to be included, with temporary delays and exemptions.</li>

    <h3>Why Should We Tax Wealth?</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li><code>1</code>. A progressive tax on net wealth is <strong>fair</strong>:

<ul>
<li>Income is not a well-defined concept at the very top.</li>
<li>Liliane Bettencourt, the L&#39;Oréal heiress whose wealth is €30B, has never declared annual income above €5M. Even a 100% income tax achieves little redistribution.</li>
<li>One solution is to expand the income tax base to include income held in trusts, holding companies, and partnerships. Another solution is to tax wealth rather than income. </li>
<li>Since return on wealth is increasing in wealth, a progressive tax offsets this inequity, and is more &#39;fair&#39; than a flat tax. </li>
</ul></li>

    <h3>Why Should We Tax Wealth?</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li><code>2</code>. A progressive tax on net wealth preserve <strong>incentives</strong>:

<ul>
<li>A wealth tax creates incentives to seek high returns. </li>
<li>A wealth tax discourages inefficient investments, encourages risk-taking &mdash; a 2% wealth tax is reasonable if capital earns 10%, but confiscatory if it earns less than 2%. </li>
<li>A tax system based solely on wealth and ignoring profit would put disproportionate pressure on loss-making companies.</li>
<li>The ideal tax system balances the incentive to take risk (which is at the heart of investment) and the incentive to smooth revenue (which is at the heart of consumption).</li>
<li>The ideal tax system combines income and wealth taxes.</li>
</ul></li>

    <h3>How Should We Tax Wealth?</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>An inheritance tax can be high, because it is collected only once a generation. Figure 14.1 shows the top marginal rate on inheritance exceeded 60% between 1940 and 1980 in both the US and UK.</li>
<li>But the average rate cannot be too high &mdash; if it were set at 50%, nearly all wealth would be taxed after 2 generations.</li>
<li>It makes more sense to tax heirs incrementally throughout their lives (income, profit, wealth taxes), rather than once and for all at the time of inheritance (the estate tax). </li>
<li>A progressive tax on capital would reassert control over capitalism, while preserving the efficiency of private property and competition. </li>
<li>Each type of capital would be taxed in the same way. </li>
</ul>

    <h3>How Should We Tax Wealth?</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>A progressive, annual tax on wealth, even at modest rates, could generate large tax revenues.</li>
<li>Because on average wealth is worth more than 5 years of GDP and, in the top centiles, even more. </li>
<li>An EU-wide wealth tax of 1% on €1M-€5M and 2% above €5M would affect 2.5% of the population and raise revenue of 2% of EU GDP.</li>
<li>In 2012, Italy introduced a tax on wealth &mdash; a 0.8% flat rate on real estate and 0.1% flat rate on bank deposits and other financial assets ... except stocks! The overall rate was ... regressive and led to electoral defeat! </li>
<li>It is difficult for one country alone to impose a wealth tax, <strong>it mut be a coordinated effort</strong>.</li>

<li>Saudi Arabia &mdash; population 20M &mdash; have annual production 12M barrels per day (approx 100 litres), an annual revenue of \$438B at \$100 per barrel &mdash; equivalent to \$22,000 per person, and half that at \$50 per barrel.</li>
<li>Qatar &mdash; population 300,000 &mdash; have 2M barrels per day, an annual revenue of \$73B at \$100 per barrel &mdash; equivalent to \$243,000 per person, and half that at \$50 per barrel.</li>

    <ul>
<li>Immigration shares the economic benefits of free trade and globalization, and reduces inequality. </li>
<li>In the United States, immigration has been a key force behind wealth distribution: population rose from 3M in 1776 to 320M in 2016, largely thanks to successive waves of immigration. </li>
<li>The less developed countries would benefit most from a transparent international tax system. </li>
