    <h3>The Race between Education and Technology</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>What accounts for differences in wage inequality across countries and periods?</li>
<li>The consensus view is that it reflects a &#39;race&#39; between education and technology.</li>
<li>The theory is based on 2 hypotheses: </li>
<li><code>1</code>. A worker&#39;s wage is &#39;equal&#39; to marginal productivity.</li>
<li><code>2</code>. Marginal productivity is determined by relative demand/supply in each labor market.</li>
<li>The marginal productivity of a worker&#39;s labor services is defined as that worker&#39;s contribution to output.</li>
<li>This theory also relies on the hypothesis that workers&#39; marginal productivities are perfectly observable and that labor markets are competitive. This rules out social conventions (&#39;fair&#39; wages), trade unions (&#39;insiders&#39; versus &#39;outsiders&#39;), monopsony (public sector jobs), and other distortions (&#39;minimum wages&#39;). </li>

    <h3>The Race between Education and Technology</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>In a society in which few workers are qualified managers &mdash; the &#39;supply&#39; of managers is low &mdash; and technology requires many managers &mdash; the &#39;demand&#39; for managers is high &mdash; a competitive managerial pay package will be relatively high (wages, incentive pay, bonuses), relative to non-managerial pay. </li>
<li>In this &#39;neoclassical&#39; view of the labor market, low supply and high demand results in high labor income inequality.</li>
<li>This theory explains certain historical evolutions, but cannot explain the rise of the supermanager in the United States after 1980. </li>

    <h3>The Supply Of Skills / The Demand For Skills</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>The &#39;Education/Technology Race&#39; theory emphasizes supply and demand in the market for skills.</li>
<li><code>1</code>. The supply of skills depends on education, training, work experience, and so on.</li>
<li><code>2</code>. The demand for skills depends on technology, which in turn depends on the structure of production (manufacturing versus services), on the nature of the <em>productive</em> capital (capital-poor versus capital-rich), on the state of knowledge. </li>
<li>No matter what other forces may be involved, the market for skills plays a central role.<br></li>

    <h3>Education</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>The supply of skills depends on the education.</li>
<li>So does the demand for skills, since only educated managers will be able to design and/or adopt the leading edge technologies.</li>
<li>Education depends on public policy, family finance, education costs.</li>
<li>Technology depends on innovation, implementation, investment. </li>
<li>Innovations raise the demand for new skills and creates new types of jobs. If the supply of skills does not rise fast enough to keep up with demand, then the pay of the skilled workers will rise relative to unskilled workers.</li>
<li>To mitigate a rise in inequality, the supply of skills must keep up in a &#39;race&#39; against the demand for skills.</li>

    <h3>Education: the case of France</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Consider wage inequalities in France. The wage hierarchy was fairly stable over a long period of time. While the average wage rose steadily, the gap between the highest and lowest deciles remained the same. </li>
<li>A natural explanation is that all skill levels rose at the same pace. Workers in the lowest decile moved up a notch from &#39;grade&#39; school to &#39;junior high&#39; school &mdash; workers with a &#39;high school&#39; diploma now go to &#39;university&#39;. </li>
<li>Inequality in educational achievements have remained but have not resulted in increased wage inequality. </li>
<li>Without the large-scale rise in average education levels, inequality of pay would have increased. Mass Education went hand-in-hand with Mass Consumption.</li>

    <h3>Education: the case of the United States</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Over 1890–2005, Claudia Goldin and Larry Katz compared:</li>
<li><code>1</code>. the wage gap between workers with a university degree and workers with a high school diploma;</li>
<li><code>2</code>. the rate of growth of the number of university degrees. </li>
<li>The two curves move in opposite directions. </li>
<li>In 1980, the wage gap started to widen after a long period of shrinking.</li>
<li>In 1980, the number of college graduates rose more slowly.</li>
<li>Goldin and Katz see the rise of wage inequality as caused by a lack of investment in higher education. They see the high cost of tuition as the main problem.</li>

  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>The United States and France suggest that investment in education raises average labor productivity and reduces wage inequalities.</li>
<li>Scandinavian countries suggest that an egalitarian and inclusive educational system reduces  wage inequality.</li>
<li>Education &mdash; how to pay for higher education and how to include the greatest number &mdash; is the key issue of the 21st century. </li>
<li>In the advanced economies as elsewhere, children of educated and/or wealthy parents tend to accumulate higher skills than others &mdash; social mobility is tied to educational mobility. </li>

    <h3>The Role of Institutions</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Education and technology are central to inequality in the long run. </li>
<li>In all human societies, education has an intrinsic value: the ability to acquire knowledge and culture. A characteristic feature of modern growth is the considerable share of both output and employment devoted to education, culture, and medicine.</li>
<li>The marginal productivity theory cannot explain the worldwide diversity of wage distributions.</li>
<li>The compression of WWI and WWII was the result of negotiations over wage scales in both the public and private sectors. In the US, the <em>National War Labor Board</em> was created to oversee negotiations.  In France, changes in the minimum wage explain the evolution of wage inequalities during 3 subperiods: 1950–1968, 1968–1983, 1983–2012.</li>

    <h3>Minimum Wage Policies</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Figures 9.1, S9.1, S9.2 show the minimum wage in the United States and France.</li>
<li>The United States used the minimum wage to increase lower-end wages in the 1950s and 1960s but abandoned this tool in the 1970s. In France, the minimum wage was frozen in the 1950s and 1960s, but was used more often in the 1970s.</li>
<li>In the United States, the minimum wage reached its maximum purchasing power in 1969 (\$1.60 an hour &mdash; or \$10.10 in 2013 dollars), when the unemployment rate was below 4%. </li>
<li>From 1980 to 1990, under the Reagan and George H. Bush presidencies, the purchasing power of the federal minimum wage fell dramatically. It rose under Bill Clinton, fell under George W. Bush, rose under Obama. In 2013 it was \$7.25 an hour &amp;mdash one third below the French minimum wage.</li>
<li>The minimum wage has an impact at the bottom of the distribution, where inequalities have closely followed the evolution of the minimum wage, but much less influence at the top, where other forces are at work.</li>

    <h3>Wage Rigidity</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>What is the effect of minimum wages and rigid wage schedules? </li>
<li><code>1</code>. It is difficult to measure the marginal productivity of a worker. For an assembly-line, management could calculate how much additional revenue an additional worker would generate, but the estimate would be approximate and would change with fluctuation in sales, prices, and capacity use.</li>
<li><code>2</code>. It is not efficient for firms and workers to agree on fluctuating wages. The firm can more easily absorb short-term shocks and provide a &#39;wage insurance&#39; as part of the employment contract. Early in the 20th century, the daily wage was gradually replaced by the monthly wage.</li>
<li><code>3</code>. Workers and firms make specific investments. Workers learn firm-specific skills. Firms adapt their organization to specific workers. If wages can change at any moment, workers and firms will invest less in the job. </li>
</ul>

    <h3>Wage Rigidity</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li><code>4</code>. If employers have more bargaining power than workers, the hypothesis of &#39;perfect competition&#39; is violated and wages may not be closely related to productivity. If wages are set below marginal productivity, a minimum wage raises efficiency. </li>
<li>Studies by David Card and Alan Krueger showed that the US minimum wage was so low between 1980 and 2000 that it could be raised without reducing employment. The increase in the minimum wage envisaged by the Obama administration, from \$7.25 to \$9 an hour (nearly 25 percent) will have little effect on jobs. </li>
<li>A rise in the minimum wage in a country like France is likely to hurt employment, since it is already relatively high. </li>

    <ul>
<li>The best way to raise wages and reduce inequalities in the long run is to invest in education and skills. </li>
<li>The minimum wage and other wage controls can play an important role at the bottom of the distribution in countries where employers&#39; bargaining powers are unrestrained, but could hurt employment in countries where workers are already protected. </li>

    <h3>Explosion of Inequality in the United States</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>The theory of marginal productivity and the race between education and technology fails to explain the explosion of very high labor incomes observed in the United States after 1980. </li>
<li>The marginal productivity theory suggests skill-biased technological change as the cause. </li>
<li><code>1</code>. The rise in wage inequality in the United States is due mainly to increased pay at the very top end of the distribution: the top 1% and especially the top 0.1% percent &mdash; labor incomes between \$100,000 and \$200,000 a year have risen only slightly faster than the average, whereas incomes greater than \$500,000 a year have grown much faster &mdash; and incomes above \$1 million a year faster still. </li>
<li>The sharp discontinuity at the very top is not consistent with the marginal productivity theory &mdash; there is no corresponding discontinuity in skill levels between the 9% and the 1% or between the 1% and the 0.1%, even taking a broad view of &#39;skill&#39; (education, IQ, experience). </li>
<li>No skill-biased technological changes is &#39;visible&#39; that would be consistent with the gaps observed by Goldin and Katz. </li>

    <h3>The Rise of the Supermanager</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li><code>2</code>. The explosion of very high labor incomes has occurred in some advanced countries but not in others, suggesting that country-specific differences are crucial and that universal causes such as technological change can be ruled out.</li>
<li>This is a major objection against the marginal productivity theory. </li>
<li>The rise of the supermanager is largely an Anglo-Saxon phenomenon. After 1980, the income share of the top centile has risen significantly in the United States, Great Britain, Canada, and Australia.  The explosion of top labor incomes explains at least 2/3 of the rise in top incomes, and has occurred in both the financial and nonfinancial sectors.</li>
<li>Figure 9.2 shows that in the 1970s, the income share of the top centile was similar across countries, between 6% and 8%. Canada was then slightly higher than the US. In 2010, the top centile&#39;s share is 20% in the United States, 15% in the United Kingdom and Canada, 10% in Australia. </li>
<li>Cross-country differences would not be so large if the rise of the supermanager were a purely technological phenomenon.</li>

    <h3>The Rise of the Supermanager</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>The income share of the top centile has risen much less in continental Europe and Japan than in the Anglo-Saxon world. </li>
<li>The top centile share has risen by 2 or 3 points of national income over the past 30 years, in both northern and southern Europe. </li>
<li>In Japan, France, Italy and Spain, the top centile share rose from 7% in 1980 to 10% in 2010. In Sweden, it rose from 4% to 7%. In Germany, from 9% to 11%. In Denmark and other Nordic countries, the top centile rose from 5% to 7%. In Europe the United Kingdom stands apart, being closer to the United States than continental Europe.</li>
<li>These increases are not negligible, but they fall short of the &#39;explosion&#39; of the Anglo-Saxon countries.</li>

    <h3>The Rise of the Supermanager</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Compare the income share of the top 0.1% in the Anglo-Saxon countries(Figure 9.5) and continental Europe and Japan (Figure 9.6) between 1980 and 2010. The differences are large: In the United States, the share rose from 2% to 10% is unprecedented. In France and Japan, it rose from 1.5% to 2.5%. In Sweden, it rose from 1% to 2%.</p>

  </article>

<slide class="" id="slide-20" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>To make clear what this represents in concrete terms, remember that a 2 per- cent share of national income for 0.1 percent of the population means that the average individual in this group enjoys an income 20 times higher than the national average (or 600,000 euros a year if the average income is 30,000 per adult). A share of 10 percent means that each individual enjoys an income 100 times the national average (or 3 million euros a year if the average is 30,000).18 Recall, too, that the top 0.1 percent is by definition a group of 50,000 people in a country with a population of 50 million adults (like France in the early 2010s). This is a very small minority (“the 1 percent” is of course 10 times larger), yet it occupies a significant place in the social and political landscape.19 The central fact is that in all the wealthy countries, including continental Europe and Ja- pan, the top thousandth enjoyed spectacular increases in purchasing power in 1990–2010, while the average person’s purchasing power stagnated.</p>

  <article data-timings="">
    <p>From a macroeconomic point of view, however, the explosion of very high incomes has thus far been of limited importance in continental Europe and Japan: the rise has been impressive, to be sure, but too few people have been affected to have had an impact as powerful as in the United States. The trans- fer of income to “the 1 percent” involves only two to three points of national income in continental Europe and Japan compared with 10 to 15 points in the United States—5 to 7 times greater.</p>

<slide class="" id="slide-22" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>The simplest way to express these regional differences is no doubt the fol- lowing: in the United States, income inequality in 2000–2010 regained the record levels observed in 1910–1920 (although the composition of income was now different, with a larger role played by high incomes from labor and a smaller role by high incomes from capital). In Britain and Canada, things moved in the same direction. In continental Europe and Japan, income ine- quality today remains far lower than it was at the beginning of the twentieth century and in fact has not changed much since 1945, if we take a long-run view. The comparison of Figures 9.2 and 9.3 is particularly clear on this point.</p>

<slide class="" id="slide-23" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Obviously, this does not mean that the European and Japanese evolutions of the past few decades should be neglected. On the contrary: their trajectory resembles that of the United States in some respects, with a delay of one or two decades, and one need not wait until the phenomenon assumes the mac- roeconomic significance observed in the United States to worry about it.
Nevertheless, the fact remains that the evolution in continental Europe and Japan is thus far much less serious than in the United States (and, to a lesser extent, in the other Anglo-Saxon countries). This may tell us something about the forces at work. The divergence between the various regions of the wealthy world is all the more striking because technological change has been the same more or less everywhere: in particular, the revolution in information technology has affected Japan, Germany, France, Sweden, and Denmark as much as the United States, Britain, and Canada. Similarly, economic growth—or, more precisely, growth in output per capita, which is to say, pro- ductivity growth—has been quite similar throughout the wealthy countries, with differences of a few tenths of a percentage point.21 In view of these facts, this quite large divergence in the way the income distribution has evolved in the various wealthy countries demands an explanation, which the theory of marginal productivity and of the race between technology and education does not seem capable of providing.
Europe: More Inegalitarian Than the New World in 1900–1910</p>

<slide class="" id="slide-24" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Note, moreover, that the United States, contrary to what many people think today, was not always more inegalitarian than Europe—far from it. Income inequality was actually quite high in Europe at the beginning of the twenti- eth century. This is confirmed by all the indices and historical sources. In particular, the top centile’s share of national income exceeded 20 percent in all the countries of Europe in 1900–1910 (see Figures 9.2–4). This was true not only of Britain, France, and Germany but also of Sweden and Denmark (proof that the Nordic countries have not always been models of equality— far from it), and more generally of all European countries for which we have estimates from this period.</p>

  <article data-timings="">
    <p>The similar levels of income concentration in all European countries dur- ing the Belle Époque obviously demand an explanation. Since top incomes in this period consisted almost entirely of income from capital,23 the explana- tion must be sought primarily in the realm of concentration of capital. Why was capital so concentrated in Europe in the period 1900–1910?</p>

<slide class="" id="slide-26" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>It is interesting to note that, compared with Europe, inequality was lower not only in the United States and Canada (where the top centile’s share of national income was roughly 16–18 percent at the beginning of the twentieth century) but especially in Australia and New Zealand (11–12 percent). Thus it was the New World, and especially the newest and most recently settled parts of the New World, that appear to have been less inegalitarian than Old Eu- rope in the Belle Époque.</p>

<slide class="" id="slide-27" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>It is also interesting to note that Japan, despite its social and cultural differences from Europe, seems to have had the same high level of inequal- ity at the beginning of the twentieth century, without about 20 percent of national income going to the top centile. The available data do not allow me to make all the comparisons I would like to make, but all signs are that in terms of both income structure and income inequality, Japan was indeed part of the same “old world” as Europe. It is also striking to note the similar evolution of Japan and Europe over the course of the twentieth century (Figure 9.3).</p>

  <article data-timings="">
    <p>I will return later to the reasons for the very high concentration of capital in the Belle Époque and to the transformations that took place in various countries over the course of the twentieth century (namely, a reduction of concentration). I will show in particular that the greater inequality of wealth that we see in Europe and Japan is fairly naturally explained by the low demo- graphic growth rate we find in the Old World, which resulted almost auto- matically in a greater accumulation and concentration of capital.</p>

  <article data-timings="">
    <p>At this stage, I want simply to stress the magnitude of the changes that have altered the relative standing of countries and continents. The clearest way to make this point is probably to look at the evolution of the top decile’s share of national income. Figure 9.7 shows this for the United States and four European countries (Britain, France, Germany, and Sweden) since the turn of the twentieth century. I have indicated decennial averages in order to focus attention on long-term trends.24</p>

<slide class="" id="slide-30" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>What we find is that on the eve of World War I, the top decile’s share was 45–50 percent of national income in all the European countries, compared with a little more than 40 percent in the United States. By the end of World War II, the United States had become slightly more inegalitarian than Eu- rope: the top decile’s share decreased on both continents owing to the shocks of 1914–1945, but the fall was more precipitous in Europe (and Japan). The explanation for this is that the shocks to capital were much larger. Between 1950 and 1970, the upper decile’s share was fairly stable and fairly similar in the United States and Europe, around 30–35 percent of national income. The strong divergence that began in 1970–1980 led to the following situation in 2000–2010: the top decile’s share of US national income reached 45–50 per- cent, or roughly the same level as Europe in 1900–1910. In Europe, we see wide variation, from the most inegalitarian case (Britain, with a top decile share of 40 percent) to the most egalitarian (Sweden, less than 30 percent), with France and Germany in between (around 35 percent).</p>

<p>If we calculate (somewhat abusively) an average for Europe based on these four countries, we can make a very clear international comparison: the United States was less inegalitarian than Europe in 1900–1910, slightly more inegalitarian in 1950–1960, and much more inegalitarian in 2000–2010 (see Figure 9.8).</p>

    <p>Apart from this long-term picture, there are of course multiple national histories as well as constant short- and medium-term fluctuations linked to social and political developments in each country, as I showed in Chapter 8 and analyzed in some detail in the French and US cases. Space will not permit me to do the same for every country here.</p>

<p>In passing, however, it is worth mentioning that the period between the two world wars seems to have been particularly tumultuous and chaotic al- most everywhere, though the chronology of events varied from country to country. In Germany, the hyperinflation of the 1920s followed hard on the heels of military defeat. The Nazis came to power a short while later, after the worldwide depression had plunged the country back into crisis. Interestingly, the top centile’s share of German national income increased rapidly between 1933 and 1938, totally out of phase with other countries: this reflects the re- vival of industrial profits (boosted by demand for armaments), as well as a general reestablishment of income hierarchies in the Nazi era. Note, too, that the share of the top centile—and, even more, the top thousandth—in Ger- many has been noticeably higher since 1950 than in most other continental European countries (including, in particular, France) as well as Japan, even though the overall level of inequality in Germany is not very different. This can be explained in various ways, among which it is difficult to say that one is better than another. (I will come back to this point.)</p>

  <article data-timings="">
    <p>In addition, there are serious lacunae in German tax records, owing in large part to the country’s turbulent history in the twentieth century, so that it is difficult to be sure about certain developments or to make sharp comparisons with other countries. Prussia, Saxony, and most other German states imposed an income tax relatively early, between 1880 and 1890, but there were no national laws or tax records until after World War I. There were frequent breaks in the statistical record during the 1920s, and then the records for 1938 to 1950 are missing altogether, so it is impossible to study how the income distribution evolved during World War II and its immedi- ate aftermath.</p>

    <p>This distinguishes Germany from other countries deeply involved in the conflict, especially Japan and France, whose tax administrations continued to compile statistics during the war years without interruption, as if nothing were amiss. If Germany was anything like these two countries, it is likely that the top centile’s share of national income reached a nadir in 1945 (the year in which German capital and income from capital were reduced to virtually nothing) before beginning to rise sharply again in 1946–1947. Yet when Ger- man tax records return in 1950, they show the income hierarchy already be- ginning to resemble its appearance in 1938. In the absence of complete sources, it is difficult to say more. The German case is further complicated by the fact that the country’s boundaries changed several times during the twentieth cen- tury, most recently with the reunification of 1990–1991, in addition to which full tax data are published only every three years (rather than annually as in most other countries).</p>

    <h3>Inequalities in Emerging Economies: Lower Than in the United States?</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Let me turn now to the poor and emerging economies. The historical sources we need in order to study the long-run dynamics of the wealth distribution there are unfortunately harder to come by than in the rich countries. There are, however, a number of poor and emerging economies for which it is possi- ble to find long series of tax data useful for making (rough) comparisons with our results for the more developed economies. Shortly after Britain intro- duced a progressive income tax at home, it decided to do the same in a num- ber of its colonies. Thus an income tax fairly similar to that introduced in Britain in 1909 was adopted in South Africa in 1913 and in India (including present-day Pakistan) in 1922. Similarly, the Netherlands imposed an income tax on its Indonesian colony in 1920. Several South American countries intro- duced an income tax between the two world wars: Argentina, for example, did so in 1932. For these four countries—South Africa, India, Indonesia, and Argentina—we have tax data going back, respectively, to 1913, 1922, 1920, and 1932 and continuing (with gaps) to the present. The data are similar to what we have for the rich countries and can be employed using similar methods, in particular national income estimates for each country going back to the turn of the twentieth century.</p>

    <p>My estimates are indicated in Figure 9.9. Several points deserve to be em- phasized. First, the most striking result is probably that the upper centile’s share of national income in poor and emerging economies is roughly the same as in the rich economies. During the most inegalitarian phases, especially 1910–1950, the top centile took around 20 percent of national income in all four countries: 15–18 percent in India and 22–25 percent in South Africa, In- donesia, and Argentina. During more egalitarian phases (essentially 1950– 1980), the top centile’s share fell to between 6 and 12 percent (barely 5–6 per- cent in India, 8–9 percent in Indonesia and Argentina, and 11–12 percent in South Africa). Thereafter, in the 1980s, the top centile’s share rebounded, and today it stands at about 15 percent of national income (12–13 percent in India and Indonesia and 16–18 percent in South Africa and Argentina).</p>

    <p>Figure 9.9 also shows two countries for which the available tax records al- low us only to study how things have changed since the mid-1980s: China and Colombia.27 In China, the top centile’s share of national income rose rapidly 
over the past several decades but starting from a fairly low (almost Scandina- vian) level in the mid-1980s: less than 5 percent of national income went to the top centile at that time, according to the available sources. This is not very surprising for a Communist country with a very compressed wage schedule and virtual absence of private capital. Chinese inequality increased very rap- idly following the liberalization of the economy in the 1980s and accelerated growth in the period 1990–2000, but according to my estimates, the upper centile’s share in 2000–2010 was 10–11 percent, less than in India or Indone- sia (12–14 percent, roughly the same as Britain and Canada) and much lower than in South Africa or Argentina (16–18 percent, approximately the same as the United States).</p>

    <p>Colombia on the other hand is one of the most inegalitarian societies in the WTID: the top centile’s share stood at about 20 percent of national in- come throughout the period 1990–2010, with no clear trend (see Figure 9.9). This level of inequality is even higher than that attained by the United States in 2000–2010, at least if capital gains are excluded; if they are included, the United States was slightly ahead of Colombia over the past decade.</p>

    <p>It is important, however, to be aware of the significant limitations of the data available for measuring the dynamics of the income distribution in poor and emerging countries and for comparing them with the rich countries. The orders of magnitude indicated here are the best I was able to come up with given the available sources, but the truth is that our knowledge remains mea- ger. We have tax data for the entire twentieth century for only a few emerging economies, and there are many gaps and breaks in the data, often in the pe- riod 1950–1970, the era of independence (in Indonesia, for example). Work is going forward to update the WTID with historical data from many other countries, especially from among the former British and French colonies, in Indochina and Africa, but data from the colonial era are often difficult to re- late to contemporary tax records.</p>

    <p>Where tax records do exist, their interest is often reduced by the fact that the income tax in less developed countries generally applies to only a small minority of the population, so that one can estimate the upper centile’s share of total income but not the upper decile’s. Where the data allow, as in South Africa for certain subperiods, one finds that the highest observed levels for the top decile are on the order of 50–55 percent of national income—a level comparable to or slightly higher than the highest levels of inequality observed in the wealthy countries, in Europe in 1900–1910 and in the United States in 2000–2010.</p>

    <p>I have also noticed a certain deterioration of the tax data after 1990. This is due in part to the arrival of computerized records, which in many cases led the tax authorities to interrupt the publication of detailed statistics, which in earlier periods they needed for their own purposes. This sometimes means, paradoxically, that sources have deteriorated since the advent of the informa- tion age (we find the same thing happening in the rich countries).29 Above all, the deterioration of the sources seems to be related to a certain disaffection with the progressive income tax in general on the part of certain governments and international organizations.30 A case in point is India, which ceased pub- lishing detailed income tax data in the early 2000s, even though such data had been published without interruption since 1922. As a result, it is harder to study the evolution of top incomes in India since 2000 than over the course of the twentieth century.</p>

  <article data-timings="">
    <p>This lack of information and democratic transparency is all the more regrettable in that the question of the distribution of wealth and of the fruits of growth is at least as urgent in the poor and emerging economies as in the rich ones. Note, too, that the very high official growth figures for developing countries (especially India and China) over the past few decades are based al- most exclusively on production statistics. If one tries to measure income growth by using household survey data, it is often quite difficult to identify the reported rates of macroeconomic growth: Indian and Chinese incomes are certainly increasing rapidly, but not as rapidly as one would infer from of- ficial growth statistics. This paradox—sometimes referred to as the “black hole” of growth—is obviously problematic. It may be due to the overestima- tion of growth of output (there are many bureaucratic incentives for doing so), or perhaps the underestimation of income growth (household surveys have their own flaws), or most likely both. In particular, the missing income may be explained by the possibility that a disproportionate share of the growth in output has gone to the most highly remunerated individuals, whose incomes are not always captured in the tax data.
In the case of India, it is possible to estimate (using tax return data) that the increase in the upper centile’s share of national income explains between one-quarter and one-third of the “black hole” of growth between 1990 and 2000.32 Given the deterioration of the tax data since 2000, it is impossible to do a proper social decomposition of recent growth. In the case of China, offi- cial tax records are even more rudimentary than in India. In the current state of research, the estimates in Figure 9.9 are the most reliable we have.33 It is nevertheless urgent that both countries publish more complete data—and other countries should do so as well. If and when better data become avail- able, we may discover that inequality in India and China has increased more rapidly than we imagined.</p>

  <article data-timings="">
    <p>In any case, the important point is that whatever flaws the tax authorities in poor and emerging countries may exhibit, the tax data reveal much higher— and more realistic—top income levels than do household surveys. For exam- ple, tax returns show that the top centile’s share of national income in Colom- bia in 2000–2010 was more than 20 percent (and almost 20 percent in Argentina). Actual inequality may be even greater. But the fact that the high- est incomes declared in household surveys in these same countries are gener- ally only 4 to 5 times as high as the average income (suggesting that no one is really rich)—so that, if we were to trust the household survey, the top centile’s share would be less than 5 percent—suggests that the survey data are not very credible. Clearly, household surveys, which are often the only source used by international organizations (in particular the World Bank) and governments for gauging inequality, give a biased and misleadingly complacent view of the distribution of wealth. As long as these official estimates of inequality fail to combine survey data with other data systematically gleaned from tax records and other government sources, it will be impossible to apportion macroeco- nomic growth properly among various social groups or among the centiles and deciles of the income hierarchy. This is true, moreover, of wealthy coun- tries as well as poor and emerging ones.</p>

    <h3>The Illusion of Marginal Productivity</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Let me now return to the explosion of wage inequality in the United States (and to a lesser extent Britain and Canada) after 1970. As noted, the theory of marginal productivity and of the race between technology and education is not very convincing: the explosion of compensation has been highly concen- trated in the top centile (or even the top thousandth) of the wage distribution and has affected some countries while sparing others (Japan and continental Europe are thus far much less affected than the United States), even though one would expect technological change to have altered the whole top end of the skill distribution in a more continuous way and to have worked its effects in all countries at a similar level of development. The fact that income ine- quality in the United States in 2000–2010 attained a level higher than that observed in the poor and emerging countries at various times in the past—for example, higher than in India or South Africa in 1920–1930, 1960–1970, and 2000–2010—also casts doubt on any explanation based solely on objective inequalities of productivity. Is it really the case that inequality of individual skills and productivities is greater in the United States today than in the half- illiterate India of the recent past (or even today) or in apartheid (or postapart- heid) South Africa? If that were the case, it would be bad news for US edu- cational institutions, which surely need to be improved and made more accessible but probably do not deserve such extravagant blame.</p>

  <article data-timings="">
    <p>To my mind, the most convincing explanation for the explosion of the very top US incomes is the following. As noted, the vast majority of top earn- ers are senior managers of large firms. It is rather naïve to seek an objective basis for their high salaries in individual “productivity.” When a job is replicable, as in the case of an assembly-line worker or fast-food server, we can give an approximate estimate of the “marginal product” that would be realized by adding one additional worker or waiter (albeit with a considerable margin of error in our estimate). But when an individual’s job functions are unique, or nearly so, then the margin of error is much greater. Indeed, once we intro- duce the hypothesis of imperfect information into standard economic models (eminently justifiable in this context), the very notion of “individual marginal productivity” becomes hard to define. In fact, it becomes something close to a pure ideological construct on the basis of which a justification for higher sta- tus can be elaborated.</p>

  <article data-timings="">
    <p>To put this discussion in more concrete terms, imagine a large multina- tional corporation employing 100,000 people and with gross annual revenue of 10 billion euros, or 100,000 euros per worker. Suppose that half of this revenue figure represents purchases of goods and services by the firm (this is a typical figure for the economy as a whole), so that the value added by the firm—the value available to pay the labor and capital that it directly em- ploys—is 5 billion euros, or 50,000 euros per worker. To set the pay of the firm’s CFO (or his deputies, or of the director of marketing and her staff, etc.), one would in principle want to estimate his marginal productivity, that is, his contribution to the firm’s value-added of 5 billion euros: is it 100,000, 500,000, or 5 million euros per year? A precise, objective answer to this question is clearly impossible. To be sure, one could in theory experiment by trying out several CFOs, each for several years, in order to determine what impact the choice has on the firm’s total revenue of 10 billion euros. Obviously, such an estimate would be highly approximate, with a margin of error much greater than the maximum salary one would think of paying, even in a totally stable economic environment.34 And the whole idea of experimentation looks even more hopeless when one remembers that the environment is in fact changing constantly, as is the nature of the firm and the exact definition of each job.</p>

  <article data-timings="">
    <p>In view of these informational and cognitive difficulties, how are such re- munerations determined in practice? They are generally set by hierarchical superiors, and at the very highest levels salaries are set by the executives them- selves or by corporate compensation committees whose members usually earn comparable salaries (such as senior executives of other large corporations). In some companies, stockholders are asked to vote on compensation for se- nior executives at annual meetings, but the number of posts subject to such approval is small, and not all senior managers are covered. Since it is impossi- ble to give a precise estimate of each manager’s contribution to the firm’s out- put, it is inevitable that this process yields decisions that are largely arbitrary and dependent on hierarchical relationships and on the relative bargaining power of the individuals involved. It is only reasonable to assume that people in a position to set their own salaries have a natural incentive to treat them- selves generously, or at the very least to be rather optimistic in gauging their marginal productivity. To behave in this way is only human, especially since the necessary information is, in objective terms, highly imperfect. It may be excessive to accuse senior executives of having their “hands in the till,” but the metaphor is probably more apt than Adam Smith’s metaphor of the mar- ket’s “invisible hand.” In practice, the invisible hand does not exist, any more than “pure and perfect” competition does, and the market is always embod- ied in specific institutions such as corporate hierarchies and compensation committees.</p>

  <article data-timings="">
    <p>This does not mean that senior executives and compensation committees can set whatever salaries they please and always choose the highest possible figure. “Corporate governance” is subject to certain institutions and rules specific to each country. The rules are generally ambiguous and flawed, but there are certain checks and balances. Each society also imposes certain social norms, which affect the views of senior managers and stockholders (or their proxies, who are often institutional investors such as financial corporations and pension funds) as well as of the larger society. These social norms reflect beliefs about the contributions that different individuals make to the firm’s output and to economic growth in general. Since uncertainty about these is- sues is great, it is hardly surprising that perceptions vary from country to country and period to period and are influenced by each country’s specific history. The important point is that it is very difficult for any individual firm to go against the prevailing social norms of the country in which it operates.</p>

  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Without a theory of this kind, it seems to me quite difficult to explain the very large differences of executive pay that we observe between on the one hand the United States (and to a lesser extent in other English-speaking coun- tries) and on the other continental Europe and Japan. Simply put, wage in- equalities increased rapidly in the United States and Britain because US and British corporations became much more tolerant of extremely generous pay packages after 1970. Social norms evolved in a similar direction in European and Japanese firms, but the change came later (in the 1980s or 1990s) and has thus far not gone as far as in the United States. Executive compensation of several million euros a year is still more shocking today in Sweden, Germany, France, Japan, and Italy than in the United States or Britain. It has not always been this way—far from it: recall that in the 1950s and 1960s the United States was more egalitarian than France, especially in regard to the wage hier- archy. But it has been this way since 1980, and all signs are that this change in senior management compensation has played a key role in the evolution of wage inequalities around the world.</p>

    <h3>The Takeoff of the Supermanagers: A Powerful Force for Divergence</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>This approach to executive compensation in terms of social norms and ac- ceptability seems rather plausible a priori, but in fact it only shifts the diffi- culty to another level. The problem is now to explain where these social norms come from and how they evolve, which is obviously a question for sociology, psychology, cultural and political history, and the study of beliefs and percep- tions at least as much as for economics per se. The problem of inequality is a problem for the social sciences in general, not for just one of its disciplines. In the case in point, I noted earlier that the “conservative revolution” that gripped the United States and Great Britain in the 1970s and 1980s, and that led to, among other things, greater tolerance of very high executive pay, was probably due in part to a feeling that these countries were being overtaken by others (even though the postwar period of high growth in Europe and Japan was in reality an almost mechanical consequence of the shocks of the period 1914– 1945). Obviously, however, other factors also played an important role.</p>

  <article data-timings="">
    <p>To be clear, I am not claiming that all wage inequality is determined by social norms of fair remuneration. As noted, the theory of marginal produc- tivity and of the race between technology and education offers a plausible ex- planation of the long-run evolution of the wage distribution, at least up to a certain level of pay and within a certain degree of precision. Technology and skills set limits within which most wages must be fixed. But to the extent that certain job functions, especially in the upper management of large firms, become more difficult to replicate, the margin of error in estimating the productivity of any given job becomes larger. The explanatory power of the skills-technology logic then diminishes, and that of social norms increases. Only a small minority of employees are affected, a few percent at most and probably less than 1 percent, depending on the country and period.</p>

<slide class="" id="slide-51" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>But the key fact, which was by no means evident a priori, is that the top centile’s share of total wages can vary considerably by country and period, as the disparate evolutions in the wealthy countries after 1980 demonstrate. The explosion of supermanager salaries should of course be seen in relation to firm size and to the growing diversity of functions within the firm. But the objec- tively complex problem of governance of large organizations is not the only issue. It is also possible that the explosion of top incomes can be explained as a form of “meritocratic extremism,” by which I mean the apparent need of modern societies, and especially US society, to designate certain individuals as “winners” and to reward them all the more generously if they seem to have been selected on the basis of their intrinsic merits rather than birth or back- ground. (I will come back to this point.)</p>

<slide class="" id="slide-52" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>In any case, the extremely generous rewards meted out to top managers can be a powerful force for divergence of the wealth distribution: if the best paid individuals set their own salaries, (at least to some extent), the result may be greater and greater inequality. It is very difficult to say in advance where such a process might end. Consider again the case of the CFO of a large firm with gross revenue of 10 billion euros a year. It is hard to imagine that the cor- porate compensation committee would suddenly decide that the CFO’s mar- ginal productivity is 1 billion or even 100 million euros (if only because it would then be difficult to find enough money to pay the rest of the management team). By contrast, some people might think that a pay package of 1 million, 10 million, or even 50 million euros a year would be justified (uncertainty about individual marginal productivity being so large that no obvious limit is apparent). It is perfectly possible to imagine that the top centile’s share of to- tal wages could reach 15–20 percent in the United States, or 25–30 percent, or even higher.
The most convincing proof of the failure of corporate governance and of the absence of a rational productivity justification for extremely high execu- tive pay is that when we collect data about individual firms (which we can do for publicly owned corporations in all the rich countries), it is very difficult to explain the observed variations in terms of firm performance. If we look at various performance indicators, such as sales growth, profits, and so on, we can break down the observed variance as a sum of other variances: variance due to causes external to the firm (such as the general state of the economy, raw material price shocks, variations in the exchange rate, average performance of other firms in the same sector, etc.) plus other “nonexternal” variances. Only the latter can be significantly affected by the decisions of the firm’s man- agers. If executive pay were determined by marginal productivity, one would expect its variance to have little to do with external variances and to depend solely or primarily on nonexternal variances. In fact, we observe just the op- posite: it is when sales and profits increase for external reasons that executive pay rises most rapidly. This is particularly clear in the case of US corporations: Bertrand and Mullainhatan refer to this phenomenon as “pay for luck.”</p>

<slide class="" id="slide-53" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>I return to this question and generalize this approach in Part Four (see Chapter 14). The propensity to “pay for luck” varies widely with country and period, and notably as a function of changes in tax laws, especially the top marginal income tax rate, which seems to serve either as a protective barrier (when it is high) or an incentive to mischief (when it is low)—at least up to a certain point. Of course changes in tax laws are themselves linked to changes in social norms pertaining to inequality, but once set in motion they proceed according to a logic of their own. Specifically, the very large decrease in the top marginal income tax rate in the English-speaking countries after 1980 (de- spite the fact that Britain and the United States had pioneered nearly confis- catory taxes on incomes deemed to be indecent in earlier decades) seems to have totally transformed the way top executive pay is set, since top executives now had much stronger incentives than in the past to seek large raises. I also analyze the way this amplifying mechanism can give rise to another force for divergence that is more political in nature: the decrease in the top marginal income tax rate led to an explosion of very high incomes, which then increased the political influence of the beneficiaries of the change in the tax laws, who had an interest in keeping top tax rates low or even decreasing them further and who could use their windfall to finance political parties, pressure groups, and think tanks.</p>
