    <h3>Some Questions</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>The 20th century wars wiped out much of the wealth accumulated over the previous centuries, and transformed the structure of inequality. </li>
<li>70 years of peace have brought hopes and challenges:

<ul>
<li><code>1</code>. the end of poverty</li>
<li><code>2</code>. the rise of inequalities</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What political institutions could regulate the accumulation of wealth fairly and efficiently?</li>
<li>New instruments are needed to regain control over the financial system. </li>
<li>The social state needs perpetual reforms, to reduce its complexity, to increase its efficiency, to face new challenges.</li>
</ul>

    <h3>Financial Crises</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Financial crises disrupt the accumulation of capital and harm everyone.</li>
<li>The crisis of 2008 was less severe than the Great Depression, because governments and central banks acted to keep the financial system from collapsing. </li>
<li>Central banks are the only public institution capable of acting as lender of last resort and avert a total collapse of the economy. </li>
<li>But these actions are surely not a durable response to the structural problems that made the crisis possible. </li>
<li>A progressive global tax on capital would promote the general interest over private interests while preserving the forces of competition. </li>
</ul>

  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Figure 13.1 shows the historical trajectory of the United States, United Kingdom, France, and Sweden, countries that are fairly representative of rich countries.</li>
<li>Until 1914, total taxes were below 10% of national income.</li>
<li>States mostly focused on the &#39;regalian&#39; functions: police, courts, army, foreign affairs, general administration.</li>
<li>States also financed some infrastructure, schools, hospitals.</li>
<li>Between 1920 and 1980, social spending as a share of national income rose by a factor of 3 to 4 or even 5 (in the Nordic countries). </li>
<li>Between 1980 and 2010, the tax share stabilized everywhere. </li>
</ul>

  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Taxes stabilized at different shares of national income in different countries: 

<ul>
<li>30% in the United States</li>
<li>40% in the United Kingdom</li>
<li>45% in Germany </li>
<li>50% in France</li>
<li>55% in Sweden</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In all rich countries, the share of taxes in national income rose from below 1/10th to over 1/3, and 1/2 in some countries. </li>

    <h3>Government Social Spending</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>The rise in government spending can be broken down into two roughly equal halves: 

<ul>
<li><code>1</code>. health and education</li>
<li><code>2</code>. transfer payments</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Health and education takes a share of 10–15%, amounting to between 1/2 and 3/4 of total cost. </li>
<li>Health insurance is public and universal in most of Europe. Obamacare is taking the United States in that general direction. </li>
<li>Primary and secondary education are free or greatly subsidised in most rich countries, but higher education is expensive in the United States. </li>

    <h3>Government Social Spending</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Social spending accounts for nearly all of the increase in public spending.</li>
<li>Replacement incomes (pensions and unemployment compensation) and transfers (family allowances, guaranteed income) take a 10–20% share.</li>
<li>Pensions account for 65-75% of the total. </li>
<li>Public pensions have eradicated poverty among the elderly. They are highest in Italy and France (13-15% of national income), lower in the United Kingdom and the United States (6-7% of national income). </li>
<li>Unemployment insurance takes less than 2%.</li>
<li>Income support takes less than 1%.</li>
<li>Total social spending takes 25–35% of national income.</li>

    <h3>Modern Redistribution</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>The modern state does not transfer much income from the rich to the poor directly &mdash; but it finances public services and replacement incomes available for everyone.</li>
<li>The growth of the state was made possible by the high rates of post-war economic growth. </li>
<li>Since the 1980s, with per capita income growth barely above 1%, there is little support for tax increases. </li>
<li>The organization of a large state raises efficiency issues.</li>

    <h3>Education and Social Mobility</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>One of the main objectives of public spending in education is to promote social mobility. </li>
<li>Despite a large rise in the average level of education over the 20th century, earned income inequality has increased. Qualification levels have simply shifted upward. </li>
<li>The intergenerational correlation of education and earned incomes, which measures the reproduction of the skill hierarchy over time, shows no trend toward greater mobility over the long run. </li>
<li>Mobility is highest in the Nordic countries, lowest in the US, and intermediate in France, Germany, and the UK.</li>

  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Belief in high social mobility in the United States is a myth.</li>
<li>The top US universities charge very high tuition fees. These fees have risen sharply since 1990. </li>
<li>The proportion of college degrees earned by children whose parents belong to the bottom two quartiles of the income hierarchy stagnated at 10–20% in 1970–2010, but rose from 40% to 80% for children with parents in the top quartile. </li>
<li>Parents&#39; income is an almost perfect predictor of university access.</li>
<li>The average income of the parents of Harvard students is currently about \$450,000 &mdash; the average income of the top 2% of the US income hierarchy!</li>

    <h3>The Future of Education</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>In Nordic countries, Germany, France, Italy, and Spain, tuition fees are usually low (less than €500). Most people believe that access to higher education should be free or nearly free, just as primary and secondary education are. </li>
<li>There is no easy way to achieve real equality of opportunity in higher education. Parents&#39; incomes are still the best predictor of their child&#39;s future income.</li>
<li>High tuition fees create inequality of opportunities, but they foster the independence and prosperity that make American universities dominate world rankings.</li>

    <h3>The Future of Retirement</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>In pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) pension systems, contributions are deducted from the wages of active workers and paid out as benefits to retirees. </li>
<li>In capitalized pension plans, contributions are invested and the returns used to finance benefit payments. </li>
<li>Most public pension systems are PAYGO. </li>
<li>In PAYGO, the rate of return is by definition equal to the growth rate of the economy: contributions rise at the same rate as average wages.</li>

    <h3>The Future of Retirement</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>When PAYGO systems were introduced in the 1950s, growth rates were high &mdash; both demographic growth and productivity growth were high. </li>
<li>Today, the rate of wage growth is lower, but it is also more predictable, while the return on capital is very volatile.</li>
<li>A transition from a capitalized system to PAYGO would be problematic. </li>
<li>A difficulty of PAYGO is that different rules apply to different professions. Governments need to establish a unified retirement scheme based on individual accounts with equal rights for everyone. </li>
<li>What kind of fiscal and social state will emerge in the developing world?</li>
<li>China is developing a social state similar to Europe and America, financed by a broad-based income tax.</li>
<li>India has maintained low levels of taxes and a small social state.</li>
