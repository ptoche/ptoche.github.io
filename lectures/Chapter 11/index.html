    <h3>Saving Versus Inheritance</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Any level of wealth concentration reflects the pattern of inheritance and the pattern of savings and wealth accumulation within a lifetime. Determining the relative importance of each is central to policy. </li>
<li><code>1</code>. Life-cycle motive: A rise in life expectancy induces wealth accumulation for retirement <em>within a generation</em>. </li>
<li><code>2</code>. Bequest motive: A fall in family size induces wealth concentration <em>across generations</em>.</li>
<li>Piketty&#39;s claim: <strong>If the return on wealth exceeds economic growth rate, inheritance predominates over saving.</strong></li>
<li>The claim is based on historical experience and calibrated model, not a matter of simple logic.</li>

    <h3>Wealth Concentration Within and Across Generations</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>The 21st century is likely to feature low economic growth &mdash; especially low population growth &mdash; and high return on wealth.</li>
<li>Growth has already slowed in Europe and Japan. </li>
<li>The United Nations median forecast suggests it will slow throughout the world.</li>
<li>Aside from the forces of \(r>g\), there are mitigating factors: the explosion of top labor incomes (supermanagers and superstars) is likely to strengthen the &#39;medium rentier&#39;</li>
<li>Two channels of wealth accumulation wealth: work and inheritance.</li>
<li>What are their relative importance in the top wealth deciles and centiles?</li>

    <h3>Inheritance Flows over the Long Run</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Figure 11.1 shows the annual amount of wealth transmitted (bequests and gifts) as a fraction of total annual income &mdash; the annual flow of aggregate inheritance &mdash; in France for 1820-2010. </li>
<li>French estate tax data is comprehensive &mdash; in 1791, French revolutionaries established a universal estate tax still in place today. The estate tax applies to both bequests and inter-vivos gifts, to any level of wealth, and to both tangible and financial assets.</li>
<li>In the 19th century, the inheritance flow accounts for about 20% of annual income. The flow peaked at 25% in 1910, then fell sharply to 4%. After 1945, the flow rises, and even faster after 1980.</li>
<li>The compression of the inheritance flow caused by the shocks of 1914-1945 was twice as great as the fall in private wealth &mdash; the &#39;end of inheritance&#39; is more than the consequence of wealth destruction. </li>
</ul>

    <h3>Fiscal Flow and Economic Flow</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li><code>1</code>. Gifts between living individuals have always played a very important role in France and elsewhere. The relative magnitude of gifts and bequests has varied greatly over time, and must be somewhat underestimated.</li>
<li><code>2</code>. French historical sources permit two independent ways to compute inheritance flows &mdash; the &#39;fiscal flow&#39; and &#39;economic flow&#39; &mdash; are consistent.</li>
<li>The &#39;fiscal flow&#39; approach records observed flows of bequests and gifts, based on tax records (and corrected to account of small bequests that do not have to be declared to tax authorities). </li>
<li>The &#39;economic flow&#39; approach computes a model-based theoretical flow.</li>
<li>The difference between the two approaches give an estimate of tax fraud and other problems with the probate record-keeping system.</li>

    <h3>3 Forces of Inheritance</h3>

  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>The annual &#39;economic flow&#39; of inheritances and gifts:</li>
</ul>

<p>\[
B/Y = \mu \times m \times \beta
\]</p>

<ul>
<li>This 3-way decomposition is a pure accounting identity.</li>
<li>\(\beta\) is the ratio of total private wealth &mdash; the higher \(\beta\), the higher the flow of inherited wealth.</li>
<li>\(m\) is the mortality rate &mdash; the higher \(m\), the higher the inheritance flow.</li>
<li>\(\mu\) is the ratio of average wealth at time of death to average wealth of the living &mdash; the higher \(\mu\), the higher the inheritance flow. </li>
<li>If  \(\beta = 6\), \(m = 0.02\), \(\mu = 2\), then \(B = 0.24 Y\), approximately the level observed in the 19th and early 20th centuries.</li>

    <h3>3 Forces of Inheritance</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>The U-shaped \(B/Y\) curve results from the 3 U-shaped curves associated with the 3 forces of \(\beta\), \(m\), \(\mu\). </li>
<li><code>1</code>. \(\mu\): In a society where the primary purpose of wealth is to finance retirement and elderly individuals consume the wealth accumulated during their working lives &mdash; the &#39;life-cycle theory&#39; of Franco Modigliani &mdash; then \(\mu\) would be very small. Individuals derive no utility in dying with positive wealth and would even aim for \(\mu < 0\) if allowed to.</li>
<li><code>2</code>. \(m\): Typical mortality rates fell from 2% of the adult population in the 1850 to 1% in 2010.</li>
<li><code>3</code>. \(\beta\): The level of &#39;human wealth&#39; has risen over time, but the importance of non-human wealth has risen in proportion, and inherited wealth has retained its importance.</li>

    <h3>Mortality over the Long Run</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Figure 11.2 shows the adult mortality rate in France since 1800.</li>
<li>The mortality rate in France fell from about 2.2% in 1800 to 1.2% in 2000, is expected to rise until 2050 and stabilize at about 1.5%, as baby boomers (born in 1945-1965) reach the end of their lifespans.</li>
<li>In the 19th century, life expectancy was 60 years &mdash; with about 45 years of adult life, the mortality rate was \(1/45 \simeq 2.2%\). </li>
<li>In the 21st century, life expectancy will be 85 years &mdash; with 65 years of adult life, the long-run mortality rate would be \(1/65 \simeq 1.5%\). </li>
<li>However, in countries where population is falling  &mdash; Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan &mdash; the mortality rate will rise during the transition, and so too will inheritance flows &mdash; if couples have only one child instead of two, the cohort size is cut in half and the inheritance flow doubles.</li>
</ul>

    <h3>The Effect of Life Expectancy</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Figure 11.3 shows the average age of death and the average age of inheritors. </li>
<li>The difference has always been about 30 years, because the average age of child-birth has been 30.</li>
<li>The rise in the average age of death raises the average age of inheritors &mdash; in 1850, the average age was 30, in 2050 it will be 50. </li>
<li>In the very long run, with a fixed cohort size, a rise in life expectancy raises the mortality rate and thus the inheritance flow. </li>
<li>In France, the adult mortality rate will stabilize at 1.5 percent a year in the 21st century, with a life expectancy of 85 years, compared with 2.2 percent in the 19th century, when life expectancy was 60 years. </li>

    <h3>The Effect of Ageing</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Figure 11.4 shows the mortality rate and inheritance flow together.</li>
<li>The annual rate of transmission by inheritance was stable at 3.5% throughout the 19th century. It fell sharply to 2% during 1910-1950 before rising to 2.5% in 2010.</li>
<li>Two effects have partly offset ageing, resulting in a rise in the product \(\mu \times m\), despite the fall in mortality \(m\).</li>
<li><code>1</code>. The average size of gifts from parents to children has risen.</li>
<li><code>2</code>. The average size of inheritance has risen, as wealth increases with age. </li>
<li>In ageing societies, inheritance occurs later, but wealth also ages.</li>
</ul>

    <h3>Wealth of the Dead, Wealth of the Living</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Figure 11.5 shows the evolution of \(\mu\), the ratio of average wealth at death to average wealth of the living, for France over 1820-2010. </li>
<li>On average, the dead have always been wealthier than the living.</li>
<li>\(\mu\) has almost always been greater than 100%. This is in contradiction with the pure life-cycle Modigliani model of saving, where \(\mu \simeq 0\). The bequest motive is far more important. Especially where pay-as-you-go public pension systems guarantee a decent standard of living in retirement. Annuitized wealth accounts for a small percentage of total wealth. </li>

    <h3>Gifts Across Generations</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Between 1820 and 1870, gifts accounted for 30-40 percent of the annual value of inheritances &mdash; mainly in the form of dowries. </li>
<li>Between 1870 and 1970, gifts fell to 20-30 percent.</li>
<li>After 1980, gifts rose sharply to 40% in the 1980s, 60% in the 1990s, 80% in the 2000s. Today, gifts are nearly as large as inheritance! </li>
<li>On average, parents pass on half of their assets before their death. The 21st century is the golden age of gift giving.</li>
<li>Most gifts take the form of real estate investment, and are received 10 years before the death of the donor &mdash; today, the average age of an heir is 45-50, the age of a gift recipient 35-40. </li>
<li>The rise in gift giving predates fiscal incentives introduced in 1990–2000.</li>

    <h3>Age and Wealth in the Belle Époque</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Table 11.1 shows wealth-age profiles for a number of years between 1820 and 2010. The elderly are typically wealthier than people in their 50s (the reference group).</li>
<li>In the 19th century, as wealth became concentrated, it also aged. In 1820, people in their 60s were 34% wealthier, people in their 80s were 53% wealthier. In 1912, people in their 60s were 58% wealthier, people in their 80s, 157% wealthier. </li>
<li>In Paris, where the largest fortunes were concentrated, the situation is even more extreme. In 1910 people in their 70s and 80s were 3-4 times as wealthy as people in their 50s.</li>
<li>This enrichment of the elderly explains the rise in the ratio of average wealth at time of death to average wealth of the living, \(\mu\), in the late 19th century &mdash; and follows from \(r > g\).</li>

<li>The shocks associated with 1914-1945 explain the low inheritance flows of 1950-1960 &mdash; parents did not have much wealth to bequeathe. </li>
<li>The collapse of inheritance flows was nearly twice as large as the collapse of wealth itself.</li>
<li>After 1960 private wealth started to rise, as wealth started to age &mdash; both \(\beta\) and \(\mu\) rose &mdash; explaining the increased importance of inherited wealth. </li>
<li>By 2010, the average wealth of people in their 80s was more than 30% higher than that of people in their 50s. </li>

  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Figure 11.6 shows two possible forecasts for the 21st century. </li>
<li>The central scenario assumes an annual growth rate \(g = 1.7%\) for 2010–2100 and a net return on capital \(r = 3%\). </li>
<li>The alternative scenario assumes \(g = 1%\) and \(r = 5%\). This high rate of return could occur if all taxes on wealth and capital income were eliminated.</li>
<li>In the central scenario, the inheritance flow would continue to rise until 2040 before stabilizing at about 16% percent of national income.</li>
<li>In the alternative scenario, the inheritance flow would rise more until 2070 before stabilizing at about 25%, the level of 1900. </li>

    <ul>
<li>Figure 11.7 show the stock of inherited wealth &mdash; the sum of past inheritance flows &mdash; according to the two scenarios.</li>
<li>In the 19th century, the annual inheritance flows were 20–25 percent of national income, and inherited wealth accounted for nearly all private wealth. </li>
<li>The collapse of inheritance flows changed the stock dramatically, with a low point in 1960-1980: wealth accumulated during a lifetime accounted for more than half of all private wealth for the first and last time.</li>
<li>The share of inherited wealth has since grown steadily to about 2/3 today, and is expected to reach 80-90 percent by 2040. </li>
<li>The U-shaped curve of the share of inherited wealth reflects the U-shaped of annual inheritance flows, with a delay of a few years.</li>

    <h3>The Stock of Inherited Wealth</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Figure 11.8 shows inheritances and gifts received each year as a percentage of disposable income. Today these amount to 20% &mdash; 1/5 of household mon- etary resources &mdash; comparable to 1820-1910.</li>
<li>Figure 11.9 shows the share of inheritance in the total resources available to generations born in France in the period 1790-2030. Available resources include bequests, gifts and labor income net of taxes, capitalized over the individual&#39;s lifetime using the average net return on capital in each year. </li>
<li>For all generations born in France between 1790 and 1910, inheritance accounts for about 25% of total lifetime resources. </li>
<li>Generations born in 1910-1920 received the lowest inheritance. The rebound began with generations born in 1930-1950, who inherited 12–14% in 1970–1990. Generations born in 1970-1980 inherited around 22–24% in 2000–2010.</li>

    <h3>The Dilemma Faced by the Upwardly Mobile</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Inherited wealth is distributed unequally, so it is important to go beyond averages. In Figure 11.10, Piketty simulates a model with observed levels of inequality of inheritance and inequality of labor income. </li>
<li>In the 19th century, the lifetime resources of the wealthiest 1 percent inheritors were 25-30 times greater than the resources of the &#39;working lower class&#39; (average of lifetime labor incomes below the median income). That kind of inheritance could afford a staff of 25-30 domestic servants for a lifetime. </li>
<li>By contrast, the top 1 percent of earned incomes (judges, attorneys) received &#39;only&#39; 10 times the resources of the working lower class. </li>
<li>The surest path to great wealth was inheritance.</li>

<li>The living standard of the top 1% inheritors started to fall after 1850, reaching a minimum in 1920.</li>
<li>The Rastignac born in 1920 faced a different dilemma. The top 1 percent inheritors received 5 times the resources of the working lower class, while the top 1 labor earners received 10-12 times those resources. It was not too different for generations born in 1940-1950.</li>
<li>In the 20th century, Rastignac would be better off in the top centile of jobs than in the top centile of inheritance.</li>

<li>Figure 11.12 shows inheritance flows in Germany and the United Kingdom, where the data is more patchy. As with France, inheritance flows follow a U-shaped curve.</li>
<li>In Germany, inheritance flows collapsed even more than in France following the shocks of 1914-1945, from 16% of national income in 1910 to 2% in 1960.</li>
<li>The smaller flow in Germany in 1910 relative to France was largely a result of more rapid demographic growth in Germany.</li>
<li>The recent rebound has been stronger than in France. The current difference between flows in France and Germany is entirely due to the difference in the capital/income ratio \(\beta\).</li>

    <ul>
<li>In the United Kingdom, inheritance flows were similar to France in the 19th century, but did not fall as far as in France or Germany after 1914-1945, which is consistent with differences in changes in \(\beta\).</li>
<li>In the United States, the share of inherited wealth follows a less pronounced U-shaped curve.</li>
<li>The main difference between America and Europe is the higher rate of population growth in the United States, the smaller capital/income ratio (\(\beta\) effect), and less pronounced ageing of wealth (\(m\) and \(\mu\) effects). </li>
