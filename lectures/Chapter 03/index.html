    <h3>The Transformation of Capital</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Figures 3.1 and 3.2 show the capital structure of the UK and France.

<ul>
<li><code>1</code>. The capital/income ratio \(K/Y\) followed an inverted-bell curve (&#39;U-shape&#39;). Stable in the 18th and 19th centuries at about 600% or 700%; very large decline to 200% or 300% in the 20th during the depression and WWII; going back to the pre-WWI level after WWII.</li>
<li><code>2</code>. The composition of capital \(K\) has transformed over the very long run: agricultural land has been replaced by buildings, business capital, and financial capital invested in firms and government organizations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The depression, the wars, and inflation during 1914-1945 wiped the slate clean and created the illusion of virtuous, merit-based capitalism &mdash; the &#39;myth of the Kuznets curve&#39; derided by Piketty.</li>
</ul>

    <h3>The Structure of Capital</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li><p><strong>3 categories of capital</strong>: <code>1</code> farm land; <code>2</code> residential land &amp; housing; <code>3</code> other types including land and buildings used for business, infrastructure, machinery, computers, patents. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>National capital \(=\) farmland \(+\) housing \(+\) other domestic capital \(+\) net foreign capital</strong><br></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In 1700, the total value of farmland represented 400% to 500% of national income, nearly 2/3 of total national capital and 3/4 of all economic activity and employment. The value of housing was 100% of national income; the &#39;other&#39; category, the same as housing.</p></li>
<li><p>In 2010, farmland is less than 10% of national income, less than 2% of capital. Housing is 300% of national income; like the &#39;other&#39; category.</p></li>
</ul>

    <h3>The Transformation of Capital</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>There are 2 main causes behind this structural transformation:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>1</code>. growing importance of housing quality and value (driven by urbanization and agglomeration for production purposes); </p></li>
<li><p><code>2</code>. growing importance of buildings and structures in the production of non-agricultural goods and services (machinery, warehouses, offices).</p></li>
</ul>

    <h3>The Rise and Fall of Foreign Capital</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>The role of foreign capital in the economies of the United Kingdom and France follows the ups and downs of their colonial history. </li>
<li>Foreign possessions first became important around 1750–1800.</li>
<li>Net assets owned in the rest of the world peaked at high levels in 1914, collapsed during 1914–1945, have since stabilized at a much lower level.</li>
<li>In 1914, the UK had the largest colonial empire and owned foreign assets worth 200% of national income &mdash; 6 times the value of domestic farmland. Foreign assets were yielding 5% a year in dividends, interest, and rent. National income was 10% higher than domestic product. </li>
<li>France had the 2nd largest colonial empire, owned foreign assets worth more than 100%. National income was 6% higher than domestic product.</li>
</ul>

    <h3>The Rise of Foreign Capital</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>These very large net foreign assets allowed the UK and France to run structural trade deficits. </li>
<li>During 1880-1914, both countries&#39; trade deficits averaged 1–2% of national income. That is, both countries imported more goods and services from the rest of the world than they exported. </li>
<li>Because their income from foreign assets exceeded 5% of national income, their balance of payments was strongly positive and their holdings of foreign assets increased year after year!</li>
<li>Thus, while the colonial powers consumed more than they produced, the colonized countries increased their debt to the colonies!</li>
</ul>

    <h3>The Fall of Foreign Capital</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Following 2 world wars, some local wars, 1 depression, high inflation, the British and French empires lost their colonies and foreign wealth.</li>
<li>After 1950, their net foreign asset holdings have been close to zero.</li>
<li>In 2010, net foreign assets are negligible, as they were in 1700. The ratio of total capital to national income is similar in both periods. </li>
<li>The most important long-run structural change is the fall of farmland and the rise of real estate and working capital. </li>
</ul>

    <h3>Income and Capital Today</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>The UK and France are typical rich countries.</li>
<li>National income per capita is about 30,000 euros per year.</li>
<li>National capital 180,000 euros per capita &mdash; 6 times national income. </li>
<li>Farmland is a few thousand euros per capita.</li>
<li>National capital includes about 90,000 euros in housing and 90,000 euros of other domestic capital, such as financial instruments.</li>

    <h3>Public &amp; Private Capital</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Figures 3.3 and 3.4 shows public assets and public debt in the UK and France, and Figures 3.5 and 3.6 show public and private capital. </li>
<li>Public capital is the difference between assets and liabilities of the state.</li>
<li>Private capital is the difference between assets and liabilities of people.</li>
<li>National capital is the sum of public capital and private capital. </li>
<li>Public assets include non-financial wealth (public buildings such as schools, universities, hospitals) and financial wealth (stocks of private corporations, foreign currencies, gold).</li>
<li>Public assets (financial and non-financial) are about 100% of national income in the UK and 150% in France. </li>
<li>Public debt are about 100% of national income in both countries.</li>
<li>Net public wealth is close to zero in the UK, about 30% in France.</li>

    <h3>Net Public Wealth</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>If the French and British governments decided to sell off all their assets and pay off their debts, there would be &#39;nothing&#39; left.</li>
<li>But these estimates are imprecise. It is not easy to set a precise market value on schools and hospitals, on railway lines, on highways. </li>
<li>The difference between financial and non-financial assets can be arbitrary.</li>
<li>When the French government privatized &#39;France Telecom&#39; and the Post Office, the buildings and structures previously treated as non-financial assets became classified as financial assets.</li>
<li>Private wealth accounts for 95-99% of national wealth in both countries. These are &#39;capitalist&#39; &mdash; not communist &mdash; economies.</li>

    <h3>Public Debt in British History</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>The UK has a long history of borrowing &#39;to the hilt.&#39;</li>
<li>During 1700–1720, public debt reached 50% of national income. During 1760–1770, 100%. After the Napoleonic wars and after WWII, UK public debt exceeded 200% of GDP.</li>
<li>It took a century of budget surpluses to gradually reduce public debt below 30% by 1914 &mdash; successive government did not repudiate it.</li>
<li>Public debt lost its significance because national income outgrew it, mostly because of strong economic growth.</li>
</ul>

    <h3>Public Debt in British History</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>The large rise in public debt of 1770–1810 was financed largely by a rise in private saving, so that national capital remained stable at around 700% of national income. </li>
<li>The deficits raised demand for private wealth bid up its return, making government bonds attractive relative to other assets. </li>
<li>From 1815 to 1914 &mdash; a century! &mdash; the UK government paid 5% of GDP every year to their (wealthy, willing and happy) creditors, financing this transfer of wealth with &#39;primary&#39; surpluses (the primary surplus is tax revenue minus non-interest government spending).</li>

    <h3>Public Debt in French History</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Following the 1789 Revolution and &#39;terreur&#39;, France defaulted on 2/3 of public debt (&#39;banqueroute des deux tiers&#39;), resorted to high inflation (episode of the &#39;assignats&#39;), and by 1815 the public debt accumulated by the fallen aristocratic &#39;Ancien Régime&#39; was below 20%.</li>
<li>Revolutions are often followed by a default on public debt: the confederate states in 1865 (end of the American civil war), the Russian &#39;Soviets&#39; in 1917 and Chinese &#39;Maoists&#39; in 1949  (communist revolutions).</li>

    <h3>Who&#39;s Afraid of the Public Debt?</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Europe, America, Japan are heavily in debt. A government bond is a claim of one segment of the population (those who receive interest) on another (those who pay taxes). Why should debt matter?</li>
<li>In the 19th century, Marx observed rising interest rates and saw public debt as a &#39;lever&#39; of the accumulation of private capital.</li>
<li>Inflation in 1913–1950 averaged 13% a year (prices multiplied by 100) in France; 3% a year (prices multiplied by 3) in the UK. In 1950-1980 inflation averaged 6% (prices multiplied by 6) in the UK, 10% in the 1970s alone. Inflation shrunk the real value of debt and &#39;solved&#39; the debt problem.</li>
<li>Friedman saw public debt as a lever of public spending and wealth redistribution. So did Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher.</li>
<li>Marx saw a tool of the rich; Friedman saw a tool of the poor.</li>
<li>Reagan was not afraid of debt. Nor was G.W.Bush.</li>

    <h3>&#39;Ricardian Equivalence&#39;</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>In 1817, David Ricardo suggested that public debt does not always &#39;crowd out&#39; private capital. </li>
<li>While British public debt was 200% of GDP, private investment was healthy &mdash; the public debt was financed by a rise in private saving.</li>
<li>The gigantic public debt had no effect on national wealth.</li>
<li>Public debt was no more than a claim of one group of people on another.</li>
<li>Writing in 1936, John Maynard Keynes felt that the &#39;euthanasia of the rentier&#39; would be the simplest way to reduce the burden of public debt.</li>

    <h3>Who&#39;s Afraid of Inflation?</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Inflation is a powerful tool for wealth redistribution. </li>
<li>It destroys the value of bonds more than other forms of wealth. </li>
<li>It destroys the purchasing power of cash for rich and poor alike.</li>
<li>It works only by surprising bond holders, who then learn to distrust government and demand higher nominal interest rates to compensate for inflation and its risk. </li>
<li>Once built into expectations inflation becomes persistent and costly.</li>
<li>Eliminating inflation requires banking reforms and a strong recession.</li>
<li>The Germans are afraid of inflation. So are the French.</li>

    <h3>Who&#39;s Afraid of Government?</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>The history of public assets is less erratic than that of public debt.</li>
<li>The value of public assets rose from 50% of national income in the 17th century to 150% in France and 100% in the UK today. </li>
<li>This reflects the expansion of the state, in particular in the areas of health, education, transportation, and communication.</li>
<li>Periods of privatization and nationalization have alternated. Reagan and Thatcher initiated a wave of privatization in the 1980s. In the UK: British Petroleum, British Aerospace, British Gas, British Steel, British Telecom, Sealink ferries, Rolls-Royce, British Rail. France, Japan, and of course the former Soviet Union also privatized on a grand scale.</li>
